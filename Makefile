# Like every Makefile, this document forms a dependency graph. Unlike an
# ordinary Makefile, there are two ways to process this one:
#   1. Start with a goal, and process its dependencies recursively.
#   2. Cheat: break an assumption that necessitates the dependencies in the
#      first place.
# After all, no one can tell you how to invent something until after the fact.
# 
# The dependencies listed here are intended to be reasonable, not absolute.
# 
# If you don't remember Makefile syntax:
# 
# - The term before a colon is a goal
# - The terms after a colon are the dependencies of the goal

	# So far, a lot of the effort on decentralizing the web has focused
	# on writing new applications from scratch. Greenfield projects are
	# fun and exciting, but it's hard to build a new ecosystem from
	# scratch. Our primary interest is in decentralization, not in any
	# particular application domain, so the apps we write are bound to
	# be worse than apps by people who are focused on their one domain
	# above all else. Many applications are so large and established that
	# trying to compete with them would be suicide even if we weren't
	# doing it on a new and unproven platform. It can be difficult to
	# tell what the requirements of the applications are and whether the
	# platform is meeting them when both are in flux (and that's why many
	# decentralized platforms are failing to meet application requirements
	# like strong-consistency or low-latency). When you couple several
	# unproven ideas together, the risk grows exponentially.
	# 
	# This is why I believe porting existing applications, starting from
	# simple open source projects and gradually building steam, is so
	# important. My vision of our success is a web that sucks just as much
	# as the web we have today, except in one way: that it's no longer
	# centralized. Then we can start working on the other problems.

porting-effort: stack-overflow deployment
	# Porting large, often "legacy" software projects isn't sexy. But think
	# about this: if a decentralization platform were built well enough
	# that porting existing apps en masse felt feasible and rewarding,
	# there are a lot of programmers who might get excited about porting an
	# app or two. Look at how mobile apps were doing for like five years.
	# That's the level of adoption we need to aim for (so that it's okay if
	# we fall a little bit short).
	# 
	# Almost all existing web apps have a sever-side component that must be
	# taken into account. Deployment and ideally sandboxing are big issues.

stack-overflow: sql filesystem
	# If we want to move to a world where new and existing applications are
	# built "decentralized-first," we need to solve the Stack Overflow
	# problem. When programmers turn to SO to find out how to query a
	# database or copy and paste some snippet of code, we need all of the
	# examples to show the decentralized way of doing things. For that to
	# happen, there are basically two options:
	#   1. Update all of the answers on Stack Overflow with new APIs and
	#      protocols and make everyone relearn everything.
	#   2. Build decentralized platforms that are bug-compatible with
	#      existing software stacks.
	# Obviously, neither of these options will be easy, but I believe that
	# backward compatibility almost always wins.

wordpress: mysql web-pages
	# https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/
	# WordPress runs 25% of all websites.[1] If you want to talk about
	# decentralizing the web, you need to talk about WordPress.
	# 
	# There are basically two approaches to decentralizing WordPress. You
	# could decentralize it as an application, which means letting people
	# run their own copies locally, while synchronizing the application
	# state (mostly kept in MySQL) somehow. This further subdivides into
	# approaches that are WordPress-specific (such as porting WordPress to
	# an eventually consistent datastore), versus approaches that are more
	# general (such as creating a decentralized MySQL).
	# 
	# Alternatively, you could just find a way to decentralize static web
	# pages, and treat WordPress as a static-site generator. Handling
	# comments and other interactive features and plugins this way might be
	# difficult. Cheating like this might help for blog platforms, but it
	# falls down quickly for other web apps.
	# 
	# If we want to port WordPress to a decentralized datastore, perhaps we
	# could get some support by starting with porting it to PostgreSQL,
	# adding a proper database abstraction layer. This is plausible because
	# there is already pent-up demand for Postgres support. Plug-ins might
	# be an issue.

wayback-machine: web-pages web-page-hashing
	# https://web.archive.org
	# Along with WordPress, the Wayback Machine is a promising and high-
	# value target for our initial decentralization efforts. We also appear
	# to have the support of its developers, which is fantastic!
	# 
	# Once you have a decentralized page host, there is very little left
	# for a Wayback Machine to do. The hardest part is probably ingesting
	# new pages: if you'd like to allow user submissions, you need a way to
	# reasonably prove the user got the archive from the site they say they
	# did, at the time they claim. As far as I understand, TLS doesn't help
	# with this, unfortunately.
	# 
	# One solution is to only accept archives from a list of trusted
	# archivists, but that's not very decentralized.
	# 
	# The only other solution I'm aware of is what I call "trustless
	# decentralized archiving," where you just try to ensure that other
	# people can reproduce a given page archive by stripping all of the
	# irreproducible parts of it (perhaps by loading a page several times
	# and computing an "average"), and then allowing various parties to
	# cryptographically sign the result. Such a system requires a large
	# number of users to get any reasonable corroboration.

google: web-pages

	# hosting, then decentralized search is relatively easy. No crawling
	# necessary.
	# 
	# Google has published some information on many of its distributed
	# systems, including GFS[1], Spanner[2], and Chubby[3]. They can't be

github: other-apps

	# It seems remarkable that a social network built on a decentralized

	# would-be decentralizers.
	# 
	# Past attempts to decentralize GitHub, such as GitTorrent[1], seem
	# have missed the mark. The social aspect seems to be what matters.
	# GitLab[2] seems promising.
	# 
	# GitHub is a fairly advanced application, and the open source
	# equivalents are relatively unproven. We should focus on more popular
	# open source applications with fewer network effects first, before
	# trying something this ambitious.

	# Yes, it's ironic that the Decentralized Web Summit is being organized
	# over Slack.
	# 
	# For a decentralized Slack, we already have Matrix and (ahem) IRC.
	# They can even bridge to existing Slack channels. Pretty much all of
	# these systems only rely on weak consistency, which means they could
	# eventually be unified with the decentralized content addressing
	# systems.

voip: eventual-consistency low-latency
	# VOIP streams are typically P2P UDP, for latency and efficiency. The
	# rest of the system could use a decentralized platform for discovering
	# contacts and other things.

reddit: eventual-consistency
	# https://github.com/reddit/reddit
	# From what I understand, Reddit has already been ported to Cassandra,

	# especially if a CQL compatibility layer were made.

git: strong-consistency content-addressing
	# https://git-scm.com
	# For completeness, Git itself (or mainly the "porcelain") could be
	# ported to a decentralized platform. Git is already decentralized, so
	# the advantages of doing this are probably low (although it'd be a
	# good demo!).
	# 
	# For decentralized Git hosting, see 'github'.

wikis: mediawiki strong-consistency
	# The implementation of a wiki is very similar to Git, and in fact

zeronet: web-apps web-page-virtualization deployment

	# platform for building decentralized web apps. It has several of its
	# own apps including ZeroBlog and ZeroTalk which look very slick and
	# are usable today.
	#
	# However, porting most existing apps to ZeroNet seems pretty much

	# To be clear, hierarchy and delegation are not the same as

	# being distributed (they're not antonyms).
	# 
	# Decentralized DNS is a well-known example of Zooko's triangle, which
	# was believed unsolvable for a long time and arguably still poorly
	# understood.

public-key-infrastructure: web-browsers dns
	# One might argue that certificate authorities provide a degree of
	# decentralization today, but I would say it is another example of
	# hierarchy and delegation (cf. dns) which is really "false liquidity."
	# 
	# Web browsers have the most influence over the root certificates of
	# anyone (including the user) and control HSTS[1]; therefore browsers
	# themselves are the ultimate certificate authorities. Domain
	# validation could be rolled into the HSTS site overnight and the
	# entire process would become vastly simpler and more secure (not to
	# mention cheaper). Basically it's a mess.
	# 
	# In the long run, a secure DNS might be able to let us eliminate root
	# certificates entirely (but DNSSec isn't it[2]; cf. dns).

	# attacks. It does several things:
	#   1. Makes it easier for the internet to "route around" damage.
	#   2. Makes attacking someone for hosting something less socially
	#      acceptable, because now instead of attacking the author, you're
	#      attacking random people.
	#   3. Makes it easier to keep, use, and even share your own copies
	#      offline, protecting them from attacks.

web-page-hashing: content-addressing
	# If you're going to mirror web pages across voluntary, untrusted
	# peers, content addressing is pretty much the only option. However,
	# strict content addressing using off-the-shelf cryptographic hash
	# algorithms doesn't work very well on modern web pages with dynamic
	# content: comments, ads, MOTDs, and other stuff changing that isn't
	# the core page content and should ideally be ignored.
	#
	# This is doubly important for a decentralized Wayback Machine, because
	# it's hard enough to verify that someone's archive of a webpage really
	# did come from the site they say it did, even if other people have a
	# chance of getting an "equivalent" page so they can corroborate.
	# 
	# The WARC format is not directly suitable for content addressing,
	# although a content addressing system could store responses with
	# associated HTTP headers like WARC does.

eventual-consistency: content-addressing

content-addressing: ipfs webtorrent named-data stronglink hash-archive
	# Content addressing is the foundation for a large number of eventually
	# consistent document stores. While it's simple and powerful, porting
	# existing apps to content addressing systems is hard because most apps
	# expect stronger consistency guarantees. That said, content addressing
	# itself doesn't preclude strong consistency, if paired with something
	# that provides it (cf. strong-consistency).
	# 
	# Content addressing is a general technique for solving the exactly-
	# once message delivery problem in distributed systems. It's strictly
	# superior to UUIDs in nearly all cases.[1] When using content
	# addressing, you must be very careful what content is used, since that
	# defines the item's identity. Several systems inject their own meta-
	# data into their hashes, making them mutually incompatible,
	# unfortunately.[1]

ipfs: web-apps filesystem web-browsers web-page-virtualization deployment
	# https://ipfs.io
	# IPFS probably needs no introduction. It's already quite popular and
	# still growing. It features a powerful networking layer with a DHT for
	# peer discovery, a file system interface, and the ability to load web
	# pages in unmodified browsers using IPFS paths.
	# 
	# In my opinion, the biggest challenges facing IPFS are apps and
	# deployment (including usability by non-technical users). IPFS's file
	# system interface is not standard enough to support running existing
	# apps unmodified. It has several proof-of-concept apps.[1] It probably
	# needs a thin(ner) client for mobile devices with limited battery life
	# and bandwidth caps.
	# 
	# [1] https://github.com/ipfs/apps/issues

webtorrent: client-libraries web-browsers
	# https://webtorrent.io
	# It's BitTorrent in the browser. Already here and working! WebTorrent
	# is probably already the most complete browser-based content-
	# addressable network, and once support is integrated with existing
	# BitTorrent clients, will have the largest userbase by far.
	# 
	# It's still missing DHT support, which seems to be challenging under
	# current browser limitations.[1]
	# 
	# WebTorrent by itself is still just a transport protocol. Building
	# serverless apps directly on top of it requires a fair amount of
	# additional work (ZeroNet is one example of this). Or it could be as
	# easy as an automated system for sending magnet links over Matrix (or
	# any other low-latency pub-sub protocol).

named-data:
	# http://named-data.net
	# Named Data Networking is a network protocol that bakes content

	# them more power.

stronglink: web-apps native-apps dns
	# https://github.com/btrask/stronglink
	# Disclosure: created by yours truly
	# StrongLink is a decentralized document store with powerful querying
	# (including full-text search), real-time (low-latency) syncing and
	# pub-sub.
	# 
	# StrongLink places emphasis on the URIs (content addresses) themselves
	# for interoperability, rather than focusing on the network protocol.
	# Instead of providing a DHT, it uses the Git model where you configure
	# other repositories to pull from.
	# 
	# Currently it's just a database server with a built-in blogging
	# platform. It's written to work as an embedded library, although the
	# API is still unstable. Only a few other proof-of-concept apps have
	# been built on it.

hash-archive:
	# https://hash-archive.org
	# Disclosure: created by yours truly
	# The Hash Archive is a project to map documents from all sources to
	# content addresses. For example, you can put in a URL, which it will
	# fetch and compute the hash using several algorithms and display it in
	# several formats. You can also find URLs for a hash, and track URLs
	# over time. There are plans to import other databases of hashes and
	# add support for BitTorrent and IPFS hashes. Also includes a list of
	# "critical" URLs for monitoring.

low-latency:
	# Some applications have a particular need for low-latency updates.
	# Protocols with more latency are eventually replaced by protocols with
	# less.

web-page-virtualization: web-browsers suborigins
	# Here's a theory: every computing environment should be able to
	# efficiently virtualize itself by running the guest system natively
	# and trapping on "unsafe" operations. X86 has finally gained this
	# ability; will the web be next?
	# 
	# Being able to sandbox and control one web page from inside another is
	# crucial for web pages that host or manipulate other pages, which is
	# very difficult right now (even from native code, because browser
	# engines aren't built to do this). Server-side techniques (static
	# recompilation) don't play well with JavaScript. And being able to do
	# this reliably, rather than ad-hoc, is important for security.

suborigins: web-browsers
	# https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-suborigins/
	# Currently the same-origin policy ties the security permissions of web
	# pages to the location they are hosted from. This requires tricks like
	# alternate domain names for "untrusted content," and in general falls
	# down for hosting things for other people or for cases where a domain
	# name isn't available (e.g. localhost). Suborigins let sites partition
	# themselves arbitrarily finely.

web-browsers:
	# Web browsers themselves have become a point of centralization. Web
	# browsers have become too big to fail.
	# 
	# I don't think Servo makes the problem better, and in fact it might
	# make it worse. Browsers are as complex and patched together as GPU
	# drivers; we need a Vulkan for the web.[1]
	#
	# Because web browsers are so large and complex, only the largest
	# companies can maintain them. Innovation is stifled because they are
	# too monolithic and cannot possibly expose enough of their inner
	# workers for outsiders to try out new ideas.
	# 
	# Web developers are also limited if we expect to use web technologies
	# to fix the web itself. Don't be limited by what browser developers
	# deign to give you. Learn C, C++, and Rust.

	# in an open network. In the long run, we will need to switch to a

	# Zooko's triangle says that it's hard to have secure, human-readable

	# solved by the blockchain[1], and since then it has worked in practice

	# 
	# My perspective is that this is merely one example of decentralized
	# strong consistency, which is why it was "accidentally" solved by
	# Bitcoin while they were trying to address the double-spend problem.
	# Zooko's "security" requirement means that either everyone must agree
	# that there is a single mapping for each name, possibly because there
	# is only a single owner allowed to change it. As far as I'm aware,
	# this is a novel result.

strong-consistency: blockchain
	# Eventually consistent databases are easy and make applications hard;
	# strongly consistent databases are hard and make applications easy.
	# 
	# I was very cynical about blockchains for a long time, so please don't
	# accuse me of simply buying into the hype. The reason I've come to
	# believe that blockchains are revolutionary is because they are the
	# first successful way of guaranteeing strong consistency (in the case
	# of crypto-currencies, known as the double-spend problem) with an
	# unknown number of peers, many of which might be malicious. Other
	# protocols like Paxos are able to guarantee strong consistency as
	# well, but they require a known and relatively fixed number of peers
	# in order for voting to work. This was so revolutionary it was known
	# as "Squaring Zooko's Triangle," (cf. zookos-triangle) but the
	# implications are much larger than DNS or human-readable names.
	#
	# I prefer to to call the blockchain a "massively distributed"
	# database. It's very different from ordinary, strongly-consistent
	# databases like FoundationDB (RIP), CockroachDB, and VoltDB.
	# 
	# To be clear, the blockchain doesn't need to store much data at all.
	# It only needs to provide _ordering_ for data stored elsewhere (such
	# as in a content-addressing system).

blockchain: ethereum namecoin
	# The problem with using the blockchain as the basis for a strongly
	# consistent, massively distributed database is that it's slow.
	# Specifically, transactions only commit probabilistically, and the
	# "settling time" is based on how long it takes messages to spread
	# throughout the whole network. In Bitcoin, this is roughly 10-30
	# minutes per transaction. For logically independent transactions, you
	# can issue them in parallel, up to around 7 transactions per second.
	# 
	# In Ethereum, which is the fastest "traditional" blockchain that I
	# know of, transactions confirm in as little as 2-3 minutes, owing to
	# its clever blockchain design[1].
	# 
	# Unfortunately, BigchainDB/IPDB doesn't seem applicable here, because
	# it offers weaker guarantees against Sybil attacks.

ethereum:
	# https://www.ethereum.org
	# To me, the exciting part of Ethereum is the blockchain that confirms
	# transactions significantly faster than Bitcoin's (~3 minutes versus

	# 
	# Smart contracts could be very useful for databases and apps built on
	# top of Ethereum, to lessen the reliance on cryptography for
	# controlling what untrusted users can do. (Think of smart contracts as
	# a limited form of homomorphic encryption[1].)

	# handle? That's how high the bar is.

native-apps: client-libraries
	# A decentralization platform might have a graphical "management
	# interface," but that should not be our focus. Ideally, these
	# platforms should be mostly self-managing and transparent to end
	# users. The focus should be on client libraries that allow existing
	# (and new) apps to use your platform.
	# 
	# Of course, existing native apps can and should be ported, in the same
	# way that web apps should be (cf. web-apps). On desktop platforms, it
	# might be enough to present a standard filesystem (cf. filesystem)
	# where native apps can store their data.

client-libraries: stack-overflow
	# Whatever form your decentralization platform takes, we'll need
	# libraries we can embed in other applications to use it.
	# 
	# Note that iOS restricts apps from spawning child processes, so
	# everything needs to run in a single address space. You can't rely on
	# a daemon process. Each app has its own sandbox so you can't share
	# data either.
	# 
	# Also remember: battery life and bandwidth caps.
	# 
	# These requirements preclude a lot of tools in the web developer
	# comfort zone.

sandstorm:
	# https://sandstorm.io
	# Typical users don't know how run servers, or want to. Docker isn't
	# the solution, but Sandstorm might be. I still don't think it's a
	# great solution compared with native clients, especially on mobile,
	# but it runs real apps right now. And people aren't going to stop
	# making web apps, so we need a way for users to self-host them.

browser-extensions: web-browsers web-page-virtualization
	# Browser extensions don't seem to be the be-all solution that one
	# might expect.
	#   1. The landscape is in turmoil because Firefox is dropping its
	#      extension API and switching to WebExtension (Chrome).
	#   2. Surprisingly, it isn't possible for Chrome extensions to add new
	#      URI protocol support.
	#   3. Some mobile browsers don't support extensions.
	#   ...
	#   n. Obviously, adoption is a problem.

other-goals: mesh-networks anonymity email

mesh-networks:
	# In my opinion, we cannot even seriously consider mesh networks until
	# the sneakernet makes a comeback. By that I mean that mesh networks
	# should perhaps be thought of as an advanced form of offline
	# communications, rather than as a second Internet (at least to start
	# with). It's possible that this will become viable if the certificate
	# authority model continues to break down, and the web of trust finally
	# reaches critical mass.
	# 
	# Frankly, I'm not holding my breath.

anonymity:
	# Law enforcement has found several wedge issues against anonymity:
	# - Money laundering
	# - Tax evasion
	# - Child pornography
	# - Bomb threats
	# Realistically, we can't get our rights back unless we come up with an
	# alternate way of tackling these problems. A police state is powered
	# by criminals.
	# 
	# Note: I'm only trying to push my _strategy_, not my _politics_.

email: spam-prevention
	# Email was designed to be federated, but a large amount of its
	# flexibility has been lost over time, mainly in the war against spam.
	# 
	# I think protocols need to use store-and-forward delivery in order to
	# let users receive messages directly to their mobile devices.
	# 
	# Latency is another big reason why email isn't suitable for building
	# other systems on top of (cf. low-latency).
	# 
	# End-to-end encryption is also a problem.

spam-prevention:
	# In my opinion, the reason spam is so difficult to prevent is because
	# the incentive to spam a network is the same incentive to use it. In
	# other words, if the ROI is positive, you will attract users and
	# spammers alike. That means it's very difficult for a system to get
	# popular in the first place without being vulnerable to spam. For
	# example, lots of people were attracted to Twitter by the idea of
	# "building a brand" and attracting a huge following.
